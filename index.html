            <li>I oversee product and data quality throughout the entire product development process, from the initial feature design stage to the finished product. As a result of my contributions, there has been a significant decrease in support tickets by 54% over two quarters.</li>
            <li>I developed an automation script to verify the connectivity of web-based data sources. The primary programming language utilized for this task was Python, with Selenium Webdriver serving as the primary automation tool.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I upheld the maintenance of our current pytest framework, which is used for our daily health check and API automation testing.</li>
            <li>I developed an automation script using the Cypress automation tool and Typescript for our API automation testing and other Web-Based Application.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with the Front-End Development Team and DevOps personnel during the code merging process to ensure that the Cypress automation, which has regression and unit testing scripts, is functioning as anticipated prior to merging the recently developed code for each release or modification.</li>
            <li>I monitored our functional test outcomes through Zephyr, which includes the creation of test cases and documentation of test plans.</li>
            <li>I provided quality assurance support during our weekly rotation to address any production issues that may arise, and collaborated with the designated support development resources to troubleshoot the identified issue.</li>
